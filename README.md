To contribute, please create a **Pull Request** to help us grow our collection. Here‚Äôs how:

1.  **Fork the Repository**
    *   Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of this project.

2.  **Create a Game Folder**
    *   In your forked repository, create a new folder for your game. The folder name should be simple and descriptive (e.g., `super-pong`, `pixel-jumper`).

3.  **Add Your Game Files**
    *   Place all your game files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, images, etc.) inside the new folder you created.
    *   **Important:** Your game **must** be a static site (no server-side code). The main entry point for your game must be an `index.html` file inside its folder.

4.  **Update the Game List**
    *   Add a link to your game in this `README.md` file and in the main `index.html` of the project so people can find and play it.

5.  **Create a Pull Request**
    *   Once you're ready, create a pull request from your fork to our main repository.
    *   In the pull request description, tell us a little bit about your game!

We'll review it, and if everything looks good, we'll merge it in. We're excited to see what you create!

## ‚ú® Our Philosophy

*   **Keep it simple:** Small, focused games are beautiful.
*   **No backends:** Let's see what we can do with just the browser.
*   **Vibe-driven development:** If it feels right, build it. Have fun.
