# üéÆ Arcadia üïπÔ∏è

Welcome to the Arcadia! This is a lovingly curated collection of small, simple, and fun games built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No backends, no complex frameworks, just pure creative coding vibes.

This project is all about "vibe coding" ‚Äî building things for the joy of it, learning as we go, and creating a fun, collaborative space for developers and players alike.


## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

Once games are added, you'll be able to click on any game from the list above to start playing directly in your browser!

## üöÄ Add Your Game!

This is a Open project, and we would be thrilled to have you add your game! If you've built a cool little game using just HTML, CSS, and JS, we want to see it.

To contribute, please create a **Pull Request** to help us grow our collection. Here‚Äôs how:

1.  **Fork the Repository**
    *   Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of this project.

2.  **Create a Game Folder**
    *   In your forked repository, create a new folder for your game. The folder name should be simple and descriptive (e.g., `super-pong`, `pixel-jumper`).

3.  **Add Your Game Files**
    *   Place all your game files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, images, etc.) inside the new folder you created.
    *   **Important:** Your game **must** be a static site (no server-side code). The main entry point for your game must be an `index.html` file inside its folder.

4.  **Update the Game List**
    *   Add a link to your game in this `README.md` file and in the main `index.html` of the project so people can find and play it.

5.  **Create a Pull Request**
    *   Once you're ready, create a pull request from your fork to our main repository.
    *   In the pull request description, tell us a little bit about your game!

We'll review it, and if everything looks good, we'll merge it in. We're excited to see what you create!

## ‚ú® Our Philosophy

*   **Keep it simple:** Small, focused games are beautiful.
*   **No backends:** Let's see what we can do with just the browser.
*   **Vibe-driven development:** If it feels right, build it. Have fun.
*   **Community:** This is a space for everyone to share and play.
